1) We have lots of spec files and each spec files we have lots of tests
2) each test can run with single test data and multiple test data
i.e. data - driven + parametization 

Approch I followed is
1) For each spec file I am creating a json file and for each test we are defining
   array of objects, 
   if test runs with one test data wch is mostly the case then only one object will be present in array
   and if test runs with multiple test data then multiple objects in array will be present
   and each object is one set of test data

2) we have test-data-reader.ts utility file to read the json as json array 
   and we are passing json file path for each spec to it

Future improvements
--------------------------

1) Make it more redable
2) instead of passing json from spec pass it from fixture or in before.All
3) while iterating check if in testdata , eanbled field is true then only run test with
   that set of test data etc.
4) make any builder pattern for redability
5) check return type of values from json file should not impact
6) Don't pass creds from json file, instead create env for them
