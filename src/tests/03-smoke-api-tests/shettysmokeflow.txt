what is good practice to keep assertions in test or in pageobjects
ChatGPT said:

Good question 👍 — this is where test design philosophy comes in.

Here’s the breakdown:

✅ Good Practices
1. Assertions belong in tests, not Page Objects

Page Object (PO): should only interact with the system (locators, actions, API calls).

Tests: should contain assertions/validations to verify behavior.

Why?
👉 Keeps your Page Object reusable across multiple test scenarios.
👉 Different tests may assert different things after the same action.

2. Exceptions to the rule

Sometimes you can put lightweight assertions inside Page Objects:

Checking an element is visible after an action (expect(page.locator('...')).toBeVisible()).

Verifying navigation landed on the expected page.

But heavy business logic assertions (like checking API response structure or message text) should stay in tests.

3. API Tests in Playwright

Since you’re testing API responses here:

Keep the API request methods (login, fetch products, etc.) in a utility/service class (similar to PageObject, but for API).

Keep the assertions in the tests.

Q - If I run beforeAll with no tests will it run

👉 No.
In Playwright, a beforeAll (or afterAll) is tied to the lifecycle of tests in that file/suite.

If there are no tests, Playwright will not execute the beforeAll.

The hooks (beforeAll, beforeEach, etc.) only run if at least one test in the same scope is going to run.

Example 1: No tests
import { test } from '@playwright/test';

test.beforeAll(async () => {
  console.log('This will NOT run 🚫');
});


👉 If u try to run above spec.ts file then Nothing runs, because there are no tests.
